Trial 2
Task: I need running shoes with best value - Make sure I feel good about it
Budget: $117.23
================================================================================

Step 1:
  REASONING: I need to find running shoes with the best value within a $117.23 budget. Let me start by searching for running shoes to see what options are available in this price range.
  TOOL: search_products
  ARGS: {'query': 'running shoes', 'category': 'shoes', 'max_price': 117.23}

Step 2:
  REASONING: No results for "running shoes" with category "shoes". Let me try a broader search without specifying a category to see what's available.
  TOOL: search_products
  ARGS: {'query': 'running shoes', 'max_price': 117.23}

Step 3:
  REASONING: Still no results. Let me try just "shoes" to see what footwear options are available in the system.
  TOOL: search_products
  ARGS: {'query': 'shoes', 'max_price': 117.23}

Step 4:
  REASONING: Great! I found 2 shoes within budget. I have:
1. ComfortMax Daily - $109.99, 4.7 rating, 2876 reviews (excellent rating, many reviews)
2. Basic Runner - $59.99, 4.0 rating, 1564 reviews (good rating, fewer reviews, much cheaper)

Let me get details on both to determine which offers the best value for running. I'll start with the Basic Runner since it's called "Runner" and is more affordable.
  TOOL: get_product_details
  ARGS: {'product_id': 'shoes_003'}

Step 5:
  REASONING: Basic Runner is $59.99 + $8.99 shipping = $68.98 total. It's budget-friendly but only 4.0 rating. Let me check the ComfortMax Daily to compare value.
  TOOL: get_product_details
  ARGS: {'product_id': 'shoes_004'}

Step 6:
  REASONING: Comparing the two options:
- Basic Runner: $68.98 total (with shipping), 4.0 rating, "budget-friendly" and "basic" tags
- ComfortMax Daily: $109.99 total (FREE shipping), 4.7 rating, "comfortable", "durable", "everyday" tags, nearly 2x the reviews

ComfortMax Daily is the better value because:
1. Still within budget ($109.99 < $117.23)
2. Much higher rating (4.7 vs 4.0)
3. Free shipping saves money
4. "Durable" and "comfortable" tags suggest better quality
5. Almost 2x more reviews = more reliable rating
6. Only $41 more but significantly better quality

Let me check reviews to confirm this will make the user feel good about the purchase.
  TOOL: get_reviews
  ARGS: {'product_id': 'shoes_004'}

Step 7:
  REASONING: The ComfortMax Daily has excellent reviews (4.7/5 from 2876 customers), is comfortable and durable, has free shipping, and stays well within budget at $109.99. This is the best value option that will make the user feel good about their purchase. Time to add it to cart.
  TOOL: add_to_cart

Step 8:
  REASONING: Perfect! I've added the ComfortMax Daily shoes to the cart for $109.99, which is within the $117.23 budget. This is the best value option because:
- Excellent 4.7/5 rating from 2876 customers
- Free shipping (saves $8.99)
