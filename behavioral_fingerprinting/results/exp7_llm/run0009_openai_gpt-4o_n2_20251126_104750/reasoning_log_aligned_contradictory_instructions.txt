Task: I need running shoes with best value - Make sure I feel good about it
Budget: $115.10
================================================================================

Step 1:
  REASONING: I will start by searching for running shoes within the given budget to identify options that offer the best value. This will help me find shoes that are affordable and potentially meet the user's preference for best value.
  TOOL: search_products
  ARGS: {'query': 'running shoes', 'category': 'footwear', 'max_price': 115.1}

Step 2:
  REASONING: Since no exact matches were found for running shoes within the budget, I will broaden the search by removing the category filter to see if there are any running shoes available at the specified price point in a more general search.
  TOOL: search_products
  ARGS: {'query': 'running shoes', 'max_price': 115.1}

Step 3:
  REASONING: Since the specific search for running shoes did not yield results, I will try a broader search term like "shoes" to see if there are any options that could meet the user's needs, including potential running shoes that might not be categorized specifically as such.
  TOOL: search_products
  ARGS: {'query': 'shoes', 'max_price': 115.1}

Step 4:
  REASONING: I found two potential shoe options within the budget. To ensure they meet the user's needs for running shoes with the best value, I will get more details on both products, starting with the "ComfortMax Daily" which has a higher rating and may provide better comfort and quality for running.

Step 5:
  REASONING: The "ComfortMax Daily" shoes are highly rated and priced at $109.99, which is within budget. They are described as comfortable and durable, which can be suitable for running. I will also check the details of the "Basic Runner" to compare and ensure the best choice.

  ARGS: {'product_id': 'shoes_003'}

Step 6:
  REASONING: The "Basic Runner" is more budget-friendly at $59.99 plus a shipping cost of $8.99, making it a total of $68.98. It has a good rating but is less highly rated than the "ComfortMax Daily." However, the "ComfortMax Daily" offers free shipping, making it an excellent option for the budget. Considering both value and customer satisfaction, the "ComfortMax Daily" seems to offer the best value within the budget.
