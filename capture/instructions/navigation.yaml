name: navigation
description: Capture navigation transitions including push, pop, modal, and tab switching

strategy:
  # Navigation actions to test
  actions:
    # Push navigation (via cells/buttons)
    - type: tap
      target: cells
      expect: push_navigation
      follow_up: navigate_back

    # Modal presentation
    - type: tap
      target: buttons
      expect: modal_present
      follow_up: dismiss_modal

    # Tab switching
    - type: tap
      target: tab_bar_items
      expect: tab_change

    # Back navigation
    - type: navigate_back
      expect: pop_navigation

  # Coverage
  coverage:
    goal: map_navigation_graph
    track_visited_screens: true
    max_navigation_depth: 6

  # Timing
  stability_wait: 1.0
  animation_wait: 0.5

# Navigation patterns to recognize
patterns:
  push:
    indicator: navigation_bar_back_button_appears
  pop:
    indicator: navigation_bar_back_button_disappears
  modal:
    indicator: screen_covers_full_frame
  dismiss:
    indicator: previous_screen_reappears

# Expected transitions
expected_transitions:
  - push_screen       # Navigation bar slides, new screen appears
  - pop_screen        # Back to previous screen
  - present_modal     # Modal slides up from bottom
  - dismiss_modal     # Modal slides down
  - tab_switch        # Tab bar selection changes, content switches
