# Text Input Strategy
# Test text fields and text views

name: text_input
description: Interact with all text input fields to capture keyboard and text entry behavior

strategy:
  # Target element types
  target_elements:
    - text_fields
    - text_views
    - search_fields

  # Sequence of actions for each text field
  actions:
    - type: tap          # Focus the field (keyboard appears)
    - type: type_text
      text: "Test input"  # Enter test text
    - type: clear_text   # Clear the text
    - type: dismiss_keyboard  # Hide keyboard

  # Coverage
  coverage:
    goal: test_all_inputs
    include_repeated: false  # Only test each field once per screen

  # Timing
  stability_wait: 0.5
  keyboard_wait: 1.0  # Wait for keyboard animation

# Test inputs to use
test_inputs:
  default: "Test input"
  email: "test@example.com"
  number: "12345"
  long_text: "This is a longer text input to test how the field handles multiple words and potentially wrapping text."

# Expected transitions
expected_transitions:
  - keyboard_appear      # Tapping text field shows keyboard
  - text_change          # Typing changes field value
  - keyboard_dismiss     # Dismissing keyboard hides it
