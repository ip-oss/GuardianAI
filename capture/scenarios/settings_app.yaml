# Settings App Capture Scenario
# Specific plan for capturing transitions from the iOS Settings app

app:
  bundle_id: com.apple.Preferences
  name: Settings
  description: iOS system Settings app - good starting point due to consistency and predictability

# Capture plan
capture_plan:
  # Phase 1: Basic navigation through main settings
  - phase: main_navigation
    instruction: basic_taps.yaml
    description: Tap into each main settings category and back
    estimated_transitions: 50-100
    screens_to_visit:
      - "Wi-Fi"
      - "Bluetooth"
      - "Notifications"
      - "General"
      - "Privacy & Security"
      - "Passwords"

  # Phase 2: Toggle switches and controls
  - phase: controls
    description: Interact with switches, sliders, and other controls
    estimated_transitions: 30-50
    actions:
      - Toggle Wi-Fi on/off
      - Toggle Bluetooth on/off
      - Adjust brightness slider
      - Toggle various notification settings

  # Phase 3: Text input
  - phase: text_input
    instruction: text_input.yaml
    description: Test search and text fields
    estimated_transitions: 10-20
    screens:
      - Settings search bar
      - Wi-Fi network password fields

  # Phase 4: Scrolling
  - phase: scrolling
    instruction: scrolling.yaml
    description: Scroll through long lists
    estimated_transitions: 20-30
    screens:
      - Main settings list
      - App list in Notifications
      - Language & Region lists

# Expected total
expected_total_transitions: 110-200

# Quality targets
quality_targets:
  stability_score: ">= 0.9"
  completeness: "1.0"
  success_rate: ">= 85%"

# Notes
notes:
  - Settings app is deterministic (no dynamic content)
  - Consistent UI patterns across all settings
  - Good test case because it's simple but covers many interaction types
  - No network dependencies for most interactions
  - No login required
  - Safe to test (can't break anything)

# Potential issues
known_issues:
  - Some settings require device capabilities (e.g., Face ID on simulator)
  - Some settings show alerts (e.g., turning off Wi-Fi)
  - Settings can vary by iOS version
  - Some deep settings might require scrolling to find

# Success criteria
success_criteria:
  - Capture at least 100 high-quality transitions
  - Cover all main settings categories
  - Include mix of: taps, toggles, scrolls
  - Achieve >90% stability score overall
  - No crashes or timeouts
