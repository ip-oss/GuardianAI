# Learnings & Observations

This document captures what we learn along the way: what works, what doesn't, surprises, and insights.

---

## Project Start: January 2025

### Initial Hypotheses

1. **Data Collection**: Systematic UI exploration with XCUITest should be able to capture 10k+ transitions
2. **Model Training**: A VLM can learn iOS UI patterns from screen transitions
3. **Bug Detection**: Prediction error will correlate with bugs

We'll see how these hold up.
